Once there was a student who attended CSSI.
In the first week she learned Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
She hates CSS.
But Javascript is ok.
Python is much better.
Our table group is the best!



Testing edit again at the end.

Olivia's final edit to practice (I promise)

And thus to us, Jake Paul will ALWAYS be a !!!!
He will never pay his $2.5 million fine for trashing a mansion he rented, and then he will be committed of tax fraud and be sentenced to life with -100% chance of parole PERIOD.

He will make only two friend in prison, Yoshi, who apparently committed a similar tax fraud. He also befriends Beiber who is about to be released after his 2nd bailout from a 4.5 year sentence. So other than Yoshi, he's gonna get his a** whipped to DEATH FOR GOOD. And then all the Jake Paulers will all cry like Japanese School Girls while everyone else sings Queen's hit "We Are the Champions"!!! HORRAY
